            # Disable the "scroll to element before clicking" behavior as this breaks tests
            # where for example a fixed docbar is used. Selenium scrolls to the element before
            # clicking it and then complains that it can't click the element because another elemnt
            # is overlaying it.
            # You have to ensure that the element is in the viewport by your own before clicking it!
            # You can simply do that by scrolling to it.

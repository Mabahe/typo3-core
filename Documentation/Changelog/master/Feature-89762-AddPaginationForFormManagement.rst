Feature: #89762 - Add pagination for FormManagement
===================================================

See :issue:`89762`

Description
===========

To increase the usability, a pagination is now integrated in the
FormManagement module. Thus, the listing is now limited to 20 forms
per page.

Impact
======

You'll notice a pagination above and below the forms listing in the
FormManagement module, which can be used to navigate through the
paginated forms.

Feature: #93651 - Provide list of available system locales
==========================================================

See :issue:`93651`

Description
===========

Every language of a site requires at least one locale which is used to format times, dates,
currencies and other values. Additional locales can be added as fallback locales (comma separated).


Impact
======

Providing a list of available locales makes it faster and less error prone to setup a site and its
languages.

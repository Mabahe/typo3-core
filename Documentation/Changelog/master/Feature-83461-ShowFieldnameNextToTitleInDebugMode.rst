Feature: #83461 - Show fieldname next to title in debug mode
============================================================

See :issue:`83461`

Description
===========

If the configuration `['BE']['debug']` is enabled and the current user is an administrator, the fieldname is prepended to the title of each field generated by the `FormEngine`.


Impact
======

The correct name of a field is important to know for developers and integrators. Examples are setting up access permissions or configuration using TsConfig.

Instead of looking into the source code of the browser, it is now enough to enable the debug mode for the backend.

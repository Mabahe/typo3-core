==============================================================
Feature: #104935 - Allow moving content elements via page tree
==============================================================

See :issue:`104935`

Description
===========

To make managing content across pages easier, a backend user may now drag
content elements from the "Page" module into a page in the page tree.

Once dropped, a modal window will open where the backend user may select the
position where the content element shall be placed to, and also change the
target page again.


Impact
======

Content elements can be moved from the "Page" module into the page tree to
initiate the move process.

Feature: #97347 - Allow keyboard navigation in live search
==========================================================

See :issue:`97347`

Description
===========

It is now possible to select results in the live search
using the arrow keys up/down and enter/tab to open the
selected result. On top the input field stays focused after
a record selected so a user can quickly search and open any
record from the result list without using a mouse.

Previously it was not possible to use the keyboard to navigate
through the search results of the live search.

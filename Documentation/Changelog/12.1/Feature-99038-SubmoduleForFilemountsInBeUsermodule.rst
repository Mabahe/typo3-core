=========================================
Feature: #99038 - Overview for filemounts
=========================================

See :issue:`99038`

Description
===========

A new submodule was added to the beusers module. It provides an overview over
all available filemounts with detailed data. Additionally an info window
displays also the references to the filemount.


Impact
======

It is now easily possible to get an overview about available filemounts
without switching to the list module on PID=0.
